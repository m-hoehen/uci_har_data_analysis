## Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
### Code book
This code book describes the data source, which has been used for the analysis, the variables, which can be found in the final data set file called "tidyset.txt", and the transformations, which have taken place in the "run_analysis.R" script.

#### Data source

* Data for the project
  * https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
* Full description of data set
  * http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
  
#### Variables
##### Subject
Number identifying the subject being observed performing one of the activities below

##### Activity
Activity which the subject was performing while being observed:
* walking
* walkingupstairs
* walkingdownstairs
* sitting
* standing
* laying

##### Measurements / Variables
All measurements/variables which have been taken for each subject performing each activity

Notes on variable names:
1. mean and std indicate that only the mean and standard deviation are listed here. In the original data source, more measurements can be found
2. accelerometer and gyroscope signals are collected and accordingly mentioned in the variable name
3. x,y,z stand for the 3-axial signals
4. signals are separated into body and gravity

More details can be found in the features_info.txt file, which is part of the original ZIP file.

#### Transformation
The script "run_analyis.R" takes care of the following steps:

1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The outcome of step 5 is the saved to the working directory as "tidyset.txt".
